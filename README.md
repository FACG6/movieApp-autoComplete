# We are Akshenha Team

## What? 
Our app is a movie autocomplete app that helps user search for any movies they're interested it.

As long as the user is writing letters in the input bar, several suggestions of movies will appear. 

## How? 
We have a collection of movie data that we will be filtered automatically. We also used an API to get data about the movie.

## Why autocomplete?

To help users quickly find and select movie names from a list of suggestions as we type.
